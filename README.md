# alice

Alice is a personal Flask/WSGI API and web server meant to handle various automations and showcase neat things sometimes. The site can be viewed live at https://araxia.xyz/.

## Primary features

- Hosting web pages with varying scripts and styling as a digital playground to learn and experiment with new things.
  - Current index page is heavily inspired by [Demonin's Item Shop's Index Page](https://demonin.com/) <[Github](https://github.com/DemoninCG)>, modifying their shader script to maintain that same oscilating lava-lamp feel but with more depth.
- Updating a personal postgreSQL server with live Old-School RuneScape item price data from the [OSRS Wiki Prices API](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape:Real-time_Prices).
- Upload server backups to Google Cloud storage.
