# Example Hosted File

This is an example file that can be accessed via:
`http://localhost:6969/files/example.txt`

The file hosting system is secure and prevents:
- Directory traversal attacks (../)
- Path escaping
- Access to files outside the hosted_files directory

You can place any files here and they will be publicly accessible through the /files/ endpoint.
