# Subdirectory Example

This file is located in a subdirectory and can be accessed via:
`http://localhost:6969/files/docs/subdirectory-example.txt`

The file hosting system now supports:
- Deep directory nesting
- Path components like /path/to/file.ext
- While still preventing upward traversal with ..

You can organize files in any subdirectory structure!
